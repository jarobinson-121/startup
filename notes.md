## Github Assignment
* There are multiple views for resolving conflicts in VS Code
* Committing, pushing, pulling, and syncing all are slightly different. 

## The Internet
* 127.0.0.1 - Localhost or your computer
* HTTPS - Port 443

## Caddy/HTTPS
* When using vim, i allows you to insert, whereas pressing esc will allow you to enter command mode.

## CSS
* '#' is used for ids
* Bootstrap doesn't have code as easily accessible for footers as it does for nav bars
* 


## Javascript
* added to HTML in almost the same way as CSS is added
    * Similar idea of referencing a file
    * inline JS is usually put in the <script></script> tag
* events
    * when something happens, and the listeners catch that event, it will trigger something
    * Much more modern than pulling the whole time
* Promises
    * Always in one of three states
        * Pending = Currently Running asynchronously
        * Fullfilled - Completed successfully
        * Rejected - Failed to complete
    * Has three special methods
        * .then() - Once the function resolves, do this
        * .catch() - If it fails(rejects), do this
        * .finally() - Do this either way
    * What to do in case internet or database goes down?
        * When you get the data from database, save it in local storage
* Async/Await
    * 
* Destructuring
    * 

* Node.JS
    * we will use it to run code on our servers
    * npm
        * Node package manager
        * allows us to use code that other people have written
        * be careful, you are running foreign code on your device

* React
    * What does react do?
        * combines Javascript and HTML
        * jsx is the code language that we will use that does this
    * Components
        *
